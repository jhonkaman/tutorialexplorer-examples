# Tutorial Explorer Examples

This repo contains 2 folders that can be used to test the Tutorial Explorer extension from Simple Dev. To install this extension, search for Tutorial Explorer in the VS Code Extensions view or visit the [Tutorial Explorer Marketplace page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=simpledev.tutorialexplorer).

Even though they are grouped into one repo, you should open each folder individually inside VS Code to test out the Tutorial Explorer extension. The contents are the same except for one key difference. The `jquery-tutorial-1` folder stores all of the Markdown files directly inside the `.tutorial` folder. The `jquery-tutorial-2` folder uses subfolders inside the `.tutorial` folder.
